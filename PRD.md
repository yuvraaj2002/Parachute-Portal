Of course. Let's translate the project requirements into a precise, no-fluff technical to-do list. This is the blueprint for what you actually need to build in code.
I'll assume a standard modern tech stack: Node.js/Express on the backend with a PostgreSQL database, and React on the frontend.


List of Core Features & The Code To Build Them

Here are the 7 core features for the MVP. For each one, I'll break down exactly what to code for the backend (the engine) and the frontend (the user interface).

1. Secure User Login & Roles

* What it is: The system needs to be locked down. Staff need to log in, and you need to control who can see and do what (e.g., an Admin vs. a regular staff member).
* Backend Code:
    * Create a users table in your PostgreSQL database with columns for id, email, password_hash, and role ('staff' or 'admin').
    * Use the bcrypt library to hash and salt passwords. Never store plain-text passwords.
    * Use the jsonwebtoken (JWT) library to handle authentication. When a user logs in successfully, you'll generate a signed JWT and send it to the frontend.
    * Write an Express "middleware" function that checks for a valid JWT on every incoming API request. If the token is invalid or missing, it rejects the request. This protects your API.
* Frontend Code:
    * Build a Login page with email and password fields.
    * When the user clicks "Login," make an API call to your backend. If successful, save the returned JWT to localStorage or sessionStorage.
    * Use a library like axios to create an API client. Configure it to automatically include the JWT (Authorization: Bearer <token>) in the header of every subsequent request to the backend.

2. Parachute Intake Sync

* What it is: The system's starting point. When a case is marked "complete" in Parachute, it must automatically create a new patient ticket in your system.
* Backend Code:
    * Create a patient_tickets table. This is your main table. Define all the columns based on the data Parachute sends: patient_name, dob, product_requested, hcpcs_code, status, insurance_info, etc. The status column should default to 'Ready for Review'.
    * Create one public API endpoint: POST /api/intake/parachute.
    * This endpoint will be a "webhook." It will listen for incoming data from Parachute.
    * Inside this route, write the logic to validate the incoming data, and if it's good, create a new record in the patient_tickets table using an ORM like Prisma or Sequelize.
* Frontend Code:
    * Nothing. This is a server-to-server interaction. The result is that a new ticket simply appears on the dashboard.

3. Staff Dashboard & Patient Ticket View

* What it is: The main screen where staff see a list of all patient tickets and can click into one to see the details.
* Backend Code:
    * Create an endpoint GET /api/tickets that returns a list of all patient tickets.
    * This endpoint MUST support filtering (e.g., ?status=Needs PA) and pagination (e.g., ?page=2&limit=20) so the frontend doesn't crash trying to load 10,000 tickets at once.
    * Create another endpoint GET /api/tickets/:ticketId that returns all the details for one specific ticket.
* Frontend Code:
    * Build the main Dashboard page.
    * Fetch data from the GET /api/tickets endpoint and display it in a table. Use a library like Material-UI Table or react-table for sorting and filtering.
    * Make each row in the table a link. When clicked, it should navigate to a "Ticket Detail Page" (e.g., /tickets/123), using the ticket's ID in the URL.
    * On the Ticket Detail Page, fetch data from GET /api/tickets/:ticketId and display all the patient's information in a clean, read-only format for now.

4. PA, Billing & Fulfillment Management

* What it is: The interactive part of the system. This is where staff do their actual work on a ticket.
* Backend Code:
    * Create PUT and PATCH endpoints for /api/tickets/:ticketId to allow updating a ticket's status and other fields.
    * For file uploads (like PA documents), create a new table ticket_files.
    * Use a library like multer to handle file uploads in your Express app.
    * CRITICAL: Do NOT store files in your database. Write code to stream the uploaded file directly to a secure, private, HIPAA-compliant storage bucket (like AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage). Save the file's URL/key in your ticket_files table, linked to the patient ticket.
    * Create separate API endpoints to log billing and fulfillment info, which will write to their own respective database tables (billing_logs, fulfillment_updates), all linked back to the main patient_tickets table.
* Frontend Code:
    * On the Ticket Detail Page, build the UI components for each section:
        * PA Section: A dropdown to change status (Submitted, Approved). An "Upload File" button that opens a file picker.
        * Billing Section: A form with inputs for Payer, Claim ID, Amount, etc., and a "Save Billing Info" button.
        * Fulfillment Section: Buttons or a dropdown to update status (Packed, Shipped). An input for the tracking number that appears when status is Shipped.
    * Each action (changing a status, uploading a file, saving a form) will trigger an API call to the appropriate backend endpoint.

5. Automated Patient Form (PDF) Generation

* What it is: A button that automatically generates a required form (like a Proof of Delivery) with the patient's info already filled in.
* Backend Code:
    * This is almost entirely a backend feature.
    * Install a library like Puppeteer (which runs a headless version of Chrome) or pdf-lib.
    * Create an HTML template for your form (e.g., proof_of_delivery.html) with placeholders like {{patientName}}.
    * Create a new endpoint: GET /api/tickets/:ticketId/forms/pod.
    * When this endpoint is hit, your code will:
        1. Fetch the patient's data from the database.
        2. Read the HTML template.
        3. Inject the patient's data into the placeholders.
        4. Use Puppeteer to "print" this HTML page to a PDF buffer.
        5. Send that PDF buffer back to the browser as the response.
* Frontend Code:
    * On the Ticket Detail Page, add a button: "Generate Proof of Delivery".
    * When clicked, this button simply opens a new browser tab pointing to the URL /api/tickets/123/forms/pod. The browser will then automatically download or display the PDF.

6. Automated Patient Communication (SMS)

* What it is: The system automatically sends text messages to patients at key moments (e.g., order shipped, order delivered).
* Backend Code:
    * Sign up for a Twilio account and get your API keys. Store them securely as environment variables.
    * Install the twilio Node.js library.
    * You don't need a new endpoint. Instead, you'll add logic to your existing endpoints.
    * Example: In the code that handles updating fulfillment status, add a condition: if (newStatus === 'Shipped' && ticket.trackingNumber) { await sendSms(ticket.patientPhone, 'Your OHC order has shipped! Track it here: ...'); }
* Frontend Code:
    * Nothing. This is a backend automation triggered by staff actions.

7. Admin Reporting & Dashboard

* What it is: A simple overview for managers to see key stats.
* Backend Code:
    * Create a new endpoint GET /api/reports/dashboard-stats.
    * Write the PostgreSQL queries to calculate the stats. This will involve COUNT and GROUP BY clauses. (e.g., SELECT status, COUNT(id) FROM patient_tickets GROUP BY status;).
    * Create another endpoint GET /api/reports/export-tickets that fetches all ticket data and uses a library like csv-writer to format it into a CSV file string and send it as a response.
* Frontend Code:
    * Create a new Admin page.
    * Fetch data from the /api/reports/dashboard-stats endpoint and display it using simple cards or charts (using a library like recharts).
    * Add an "Export to CSV" button that, when clicked, hits the export endpoint, triggering a file download in the browser.
You've made an excellent point. You are correct, the project plan in the document doesn't specify the exact columns for the dashboard. That's a crucial detail for making the system truly useful.
Based on your requirements, hereâ€™s a breakdown of what the dashboard should display.


Dashboard Columns (Visible at a Glance)

The main goal of the dashboard is to give your staff a quick overview to prioritize their work. It should be clean and scannable. I'd recommend the following columns:
* Patient Name: The primary identifier for each ticket.
* Product Requested: Key context, like "CGM" or "CPAP".
* Current Status: The most important column. This shows exactly where the ticket is in the workflow (e.g., Ready for Review, Needs PA, Ready for Billing).
* Assigned Staff: Shows who is responsible for the ticket at that moment.
* Referral Source: Important for tracking where your business is coming from.
* Date Received: To quickly see how long a ticket has been in the system.


Editable Fields on the Dashboard

While most detailed edits should happen on the "Ticket Detail View," it's efficient to allow quick changes to the most common fields directly from the dashboard:
* Current Status: This should be an editable dropdown menu directly in the table row. This allows staff to quickly move a ticket to the next stage without having to click into it.
* Assigned Staff: This should also be a dropdown, making it easy for an admin to reassign tasks on the fly.
All other detailed information (like Diagnosis Codes, Insurance Info, Notes, File Attachments, etc.) would be located inside the Ticket Detail View that you access by clicking on a patient's name. This keeps the main dashboard uncluttered and focused on workflow.
Based on the scope document you provided, here are the specific documents mentioned for each phase:


Phase 4: Interactive Workflow Management

This phase is about uploading existing documents that you receive from outside sources. The documents mentioned are:
* CMN (Certificate of Medical Necessity)
* PA (Prior Authorization request and response files)
* RX (Prescription files)
* Eligibility Screenshots


Phase 5: Patient Form Automation

This phase is about the system generating new documents automatically. The forms mentioned are:
* Medicare Packet
* Proof of Delivery (POD)
* Assignment of Benefits (AOB)
* Supplier Agreement
